# PMP Preparation Guide
I began my PMP certification journey in February 2025 and earned my credential in May 2025. The process was challenging but rewarding, giving me deeper insight into project management best practices and Agile frameworks.

I’m sharing my experience, study plan, and tips to help others who are considering pursuing the PMP certification—whether you’re new to project management or looking to formalize your skills with a globally recognized credential.

## Prerequisites
PMI clearly outlines eligibility requirements on their official [PMP Certification Page](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp).

I qualified under the Set B requirements:
- Bachelor's degree or higher (or global equivalent)
- 36 months/3 years experience leading and managing projects within the past eight years
- 35 hours of project management education/training

## Application
I followed the [PMP Application guide from CareerSprints](https://www.careersprints.com/post/how-to-fill-your-pmp-application-form-like-a-pro-with-examples) guide for my PMP application. For the project descriptions, I followed the **five process groups** from **PMBOK Guide, 6th Edition**:
1. **Initiating**
2. **Planning**
3. **Executing**
4. **Monitoring and Controlling**
5. **Closing**

This method not only aligns with PMI's requirement to support your eligibility, but also showcases your PMP knowledge.

Here’s how I structured each project in my application:

- Start with a high-level summary (Include your role, project goal, and organization context.)
- Key responsibilities
  - **Initiating**: Contributed to the business case, identified stakeholders
  - **Planning**: Defined scope, timeline, cost, quality, risk, and resources
  - **Executing**: Led the team to deliver on milestones and project deliverables
  - **Monitoring and Controlling**: Tracked progress, managed changes, and controlled quality
  - **Closing**: Finalized deliverables, conducted retrospectives, transitioned ownership
- End with a brief summary of the project outcomes (E.g., delivered on time, under budget, improved customer satisfaction, etc.)

Some applicants also find it helpful to structure their descriptions using frameworks such as:
- **STAR**: <ins>**S**</ins>ituation, <ins>**T**</ins>ask, <ins>**A**</ins>ction, <ins>**R**</ins>esult
- **SOAR**: <ins>**S**</ins>ituation, <ins>**O**</ins>bstacle, <ins>**A**</ins>ction, <ins>**R**</ins>esult

I have submitted my PMP application on March 13 and was approved on March 19.

## Training
To meet the 35-hour project management education requirement for PMP certification, I completed the [Google Project Management: Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management).

### Cost
The certificate is accessed through a Coursera subscription, which costs $49 USD or $70 CAD per month and includes a 7-day free trial. I completed the program in 5 weeks, so I only paid for one month.

### Pros and Cons
#### Pros
- **Affordable**: Much more budget-friendly than PMP bootcamps, which can cost upwards of $2,000 CAD.
- **Flexible**: Self-paced and accessible anytime, allowing you to learn at your convenience.
- **Structured**: Offers a beginner-friendly overview of project management with practical examples and exercises.
#### Cons
- **Limited Depth**: The content is simplified and more suited for beginners; additional study is required for PMP-level knowledge.
- **No Networking or Live Support**: Lacks real-time interaction or instructor feedback. Peer learning is limited and often delayed.
- **Not a PMP-Specific Prep Course**: The course doesn't cover PMP exam structure, question style, or test-taking strategies.

**Tip**: You can supplement this training with free PMP-focused resources (see next section).

## Online Resources

YouTube has a lot of free PMP content. I found these two channels especially helpful for me.

- [Agile Practice Guide](https://www.pmi.org/standards/agile) – Important for Agile and hybrid methodologies.
- [Process Groups: A Practice Guide](https://www.pmi.org/standards/process-groups) – Helpful to understand process group mapping to real-world activities.

## My PMP Exam Preparation Plan
Here's the roadmap I followed to prepare and pass the PMP exam:
1. **Foundation**: Completed the Google Project Management: Professional Certificate on Coursera to build foundational knowledge.
2. **In-Depth Study**: Studied Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep and filled in knowledge gaps with PMI standards (PMBOK, Agile Guide, Process Groups Guide).
3. **Practice with YouTube**: Watched practice question walkthroughs by David McLachlan and Andrew Ramdayal. Understand why your answers are wrong. Cross-reference with books if unsure.
4. **Short Practice Exams (Untimed)**: Start with shorter exams (ie: 50 questions) to build confidence.
5. **Formula and Definition**: Print out formulas and tables from PMBOK guide to use as reference. Memorize formulas and definitions that come up repeatedly in practice exams.
6. **Long Practice Exams (Timed)**: Used LinkedIn Learning full-length tests to simulate exam conditions. Score 70%+ consistently before moving on.
7. **PMI Study Hall**: The exam style and interface are mimicks the real exam, including features such as highlighter, calculator and sections for notes.
8. **Final Review**: Reviewed exam tips on YouTube (test-taking strategy, mindset, time management).

## Exam Day
PMP Exam can be taken online or at a Pearson VUE test center. I chose to take my exam at my local Pearson VUE location for the following reason:
1. **Clear My Mind**: I took public transportation, which gave me time to calm my nerves and mentally prepare.
2. **Better Focus**: Test centers offer a quiet, monitored environment. No risk of disqualification due to webcam or background noise issues, which can happen in online exams.

## After Thoughts
It took me just under 4 months from application to certification. While some advertise passing the exam in 30 days (or even 14), often with minimal experience, I believe that goes against the spirit of the certification.

My goal was not just to pass, but to:
- Deepen my understanding of project management principles
- Reflect on past experiences and mistakes
- Improve my ability to manage risk, lead teams, and optimize outcomes
- Demonstrate commitment to professional excellence

I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned in my next role and continue growing as a project leader.

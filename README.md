# PMP Preparation Guide
I began my PMP certification journey in February 2025 and officially became PMP-certified in May 2025. I’m sharing my experience to help others who are considering this certification.

## Prerequisites
PMI clearly outlines eligibility requirements on their official [PMP Certification Page](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp).

I qualified under the Set B requirements:
- Bachelor's degree or higher (or global equivalent)
- 36 months/3 years experience leading and managing projects within the past eight years
- 35 hours of project management education/training

## Application
I followed the [PMP Application guide from CareerSprints](https://www.careersprints.com/post/how-to-fill-your-pmp-application-form-like-a-pro-with-examples) guide for my PMP application. For the project descriptions, I followed the **five process groups** from **PMBOK Guide, 6th Edition**:
1. **Initiating**
2. **Planning**
3. **Executing**
4. **Monitoring and Controlling**
5. **Closing**

This method not only aligns with PMI's requirement to support your eligibility, but also showcases your PMP knowledge.

Here’s how I structured each project in my application:

- Start with a high-level summary (Include your role, project goal, and organization context.)
- Key responsibilities
  - **Initiating**: Contributed to the business case, identified stakeholders
  - **Planning**: Defined scope, timeline, cost, quality, risk, and resources
  - **Executing**: Led the team to deliver on milestones and project deliverables
  - **Monitoring and Controlling**: Tracked progress, managed changes, and controlled quality
  - **Closing**: Finalized deliverables, conducted retrospectives, transitioned ownership
- End with a brief summary of the project outcomes (E.g., delivered on time, under budget, improved customer satisfaction, etc.)

Some applicants also find it helpful to structure their descriptions using frameworks such as:
- **STAR**: <ins>**S**</ins>ituation, <ins>**T**</ins>ask, <ins>**A**</ins>ction, <ins>**R**</ins>esult
- **SOAR**: <ins>**S**</ins>ituation, <ins>**O**</ins>bstacle, <ins>**A**</ins>ction, <ins>**R**</ins>esult

I have submitted my PMP application on March 13 and was approved on March 19.

## Training
To meet the 35-hour project management education requirement for PMP certification, I completed the [Google Project Management: Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management).

### Cost
The certificate is accessed through a Coursera subscription, which costs approximately $70 CAD per month and includes a 7-day free trial. I completed the program in 5 weeks, so I only paid for one month.

### Pros and Cons
#### Pros
- **Affordable**: Much more budget-friendly than PMP bootcamps, which can cost upwards of $2,000 CAD.
- **Flexible**: Self-paced and accessible anytime, allowing you to learn at your convenience.
- **Structured**: Offers a beginner-friendly overview of project management with practical examples and exercises.
#### Cons
- **Limited Depth**: The content is simplified and more suited for beginners; additional study is required for PMP-level knowledge.
- **No Networking or Live Support**: Lacks real-time interaction or instructor feedback. Peer learning is limited and often delayed.
- **Not a PMP-Specific Prep Course**: The course doesn't cover PMP exam structure, question style, or test-taking strategies.

**Tip**: You can supplement this training with free PMP-focused resources (see next section).

YouTube has a lot of free PMP content. I found these two channels especially helpful for me.

# PMP Preparation Guide
I began my PMP certification journey in February 2025 and officially became PMP-certified in May 2025. I’m sharing my experience to help others who are considering this certification.

## Prerequisites
PMI clearly outlines eligibility requirements on their official [PMP Certification Page](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp).

I qualified under the Set B requirements:
- Bachelor's degree or higher (or global equivalent)
- 36 months/3 years experience leading and managing projects within the past eight years
- 35 hours of project management education/training

## Application
I followed the [PMP Application guide from CareerSprints](https://www.careersprints.com/post/how-to-fill-your-pmp-application-form-like-a-pro-with-examples) guide for my PMP application. For the project descriptions, I followed the **five process groups** from **PMBOK Guide, 6th Edition**:
1. **Initiating**
2. **Planning**
3. **Executing**
4. **Monitoring and Controlling**
5. **Closing**

This method not only aligns with PMI's requirement to support your eligibility, but also showcases your PMP knowledge.

Here’s how I structured each project in my application:

- Start with a high-level summary (Include your role, project goal, and organization context.)
- Key responsibilities
  - **Initiating:** Contributed to the business case, identified stakeholders
  - **Planning:** Defined scope, timeline, cost, quality, risk, and resources
  - **Executing:** Led the team to deliver on milestones and project deliverables
  - **Monitoring and Controlling:** Tracked progress, managed changes, and controlled quality
  - **Closing:** Finalized deliverables, conducted retrospectives, transitioned ownership
- End with a brief summary of the project outcomes (E.g., delivered on time, under budget, improved customer satisfaction, etc.)

Some applicants also find it helpful to structure their descriptions using frameworks such as:
- **STAR**: <ins>**S**</ins>ituation, <ins>**T**</ins>ask, <ins>**A**</ins>ction, <ins>**R**</ins>esult
- **SOAR**: <ins>**S**</ins>ituation, <ins>**O**</ins>bstacle, <ins>**A**</ins>ction, <ins>**R**</ins>esult

I have submitted my PMP application on March 13 and was approved on March 19.
